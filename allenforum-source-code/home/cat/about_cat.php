• You get an opportunity to join a prestigious MBA program at a premier b-school. And even beyond that, there are relatively good tier 2 b-schools that offer well designed courses.<br>

• If you are giving other exams like XAT and PO, CAT helps set up the stage for you to be confident in a pressure situation .<br>


• You would know where you stand. Mock tests are all good and fine, but only after a real exam, will you know how much you need to move forward or how well you can do. This will prepare you for next year. <br></p>
